"# C programs--
I'm passionate about learning different programming languages as I try to sharpen my skills to enter into the software development industry. I have so far
learnt Java, C++, Python, C#, PHP, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, SQL, and HTML/CSS. This repository contains my codes from my daily practices for C programming.
While I have learnt these various languages, I have to state that I'm not an expert in all of them but my knowledge for them is good enough to write
working software applications. I use this git space to ensure that I do not lose my programs as I value every small useful thing I do in every second
of my time."
